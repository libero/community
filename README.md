# Welcome to the Libero Community
This is a place for community-wide issues, discussion, resources, files and sharing.
## What is Libero?
Libero is eLife’s open-source platform of services and applications to help publishers do more with everything they publish.

Built in a modular fashion from the ground up, Libero adjusts to each journal’s individual needs to help deliver scholarly content to the highest standards in design and usability, while also providing machine-readable versions and lowering publishing costs.

It is a community-driven effort with decision making, coding and deployment all done in the open.

## Requests for Comments
In the interests of community involvement and openness, any member of the community can issue a request for comments (RFC) for any major decision that affects more than one party in the community or makes a significant difference to a component, module, application or service in the platform.

RFCs should be posted as issues in this repository, or in the repository most relevant to the RFC. You can [find open RFCs for the whole community by searching this repository's issues for RFC](https://github.com/libero/community/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+rfc)

There is a time limit on RFCs and when a decision has been made following a discussion (on the issue or in person), the issue will be updated and closed. Where appropriate a corresponding [architectural decision record](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/lightweight-architecture-decision-records) may be created.

## Community Meetings
The community aims to meet, either in person or online, at least four times per year. The first meeting being in March 2018.
