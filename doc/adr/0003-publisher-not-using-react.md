# 3. Publisher not using React

Date: 2019-10-01

## Status

Proposed

## Context
Libero Publisher needs a read-optimised, highly performant, progressively enhanced front end.

## [Decision](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FkdvBjSb1BH1fhgujtppunvL_NX5U3xVuxv7L0fV010/edit#heading=h.oip2sudw7pju)
We will not use the React ecosystem for Libero Publisher.

## Consequences
Libero Publisher front end can be light weight.

Libero Publisher will not be able to share pattern template code with Libero Reviewer.
